        <h2>Hoppy Days</h2>
        <p>Godot Game Engine</p>
        <p>Hoppy Days is a simple platformer example made in Godot. Godot is an open source game engine that uses a Python like programming language called GDscript. This is a simple sample level that I cretaed as part of a course for learning the Godot game engine.</p>

        <p>Static Web Page Development</p>
        <p>This website is an example that I am currently creating as a way of showing off my HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap skills.</p>

        <h2>Heist Meisters</h2>
        <p>Godot Game Engine</p>
        <p>This is another example from the Godot Game engine. This time instead of working on a simple platformer I upgraded to a top down stealth game. This has a little bit more comlicated logic behind it with more AI and events in the background. This game is also a simple demo of a game and has a lot of room for expansion.</p>
